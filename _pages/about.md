I am now a second year Ph.D. student in THUIR, [Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/). My major research interests are about domain-specific applications, user behavior analysis and search evaluation.
